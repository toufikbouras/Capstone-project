# Capstone-project

There are two files: the first one is for the functions and the second one is for the execution of those functions.Make sure to put them in the same directory(file).
 You need to install ipynb in order to be able to upload the functions.
You need to install xgboost so you can run this model.
If you want to run the bayesian model you will need to install pystan, and uncomment the data (clean_df1) in the middle of the kernel, as well as the model in the bottom of the kernel.
Gridsearch may take too long to process, so you might consider using cloud or comment it out.
